#  😊My Personal Web 😊

Pretty self-explanatory, a website that displays in a cute way all my projects and businesses.

It also contains a little page with more about me as a person. 🧐 

Let's get a job or live by my own! 🚀🚀🚀

## Tools Used

Build with NextJs and Yarn.




## TODO LIST:

    1.- Learn better TypeScript in react (replace any types).

    2.- Refactor SASS code, make it clean.

    3.- Use Three.js to 3D animate the page.

    4.- Checkout SEO html tags.

    5.- Add loading image when loading times.
